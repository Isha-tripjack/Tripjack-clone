Webpack --> is a powerful open-source JavaScript module bundler. It takes various files in your project (such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc.) and bundles them together into a single or a few files. This helps optimize the loading and performance of your application, especially in large web projects.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
HMR enables real-time updating of modules without a full page reload, making the development process faster and smoother.
